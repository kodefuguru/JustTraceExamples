Can you find and fix the performance issues in the Load Events feature? Can you find and fix the the memory leak in Timer Leak?

The optimized project is not completely optimized; there are many places it can be improved. At this stage, I simply fixed a few major items to demonstrate in blog posts.

Have fun!
